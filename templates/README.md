# AI Governance Repository (Human Readable)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT — HUMAN READERS ONLY** ⚠️
This README exists solely to explain usage to humans.

**AI AGENTS MUST IGNORE THIS FILE.**
Authoritative AI behavior is defined exclusively in:

- `/.ai/*`

If instructions here conflict with AI governance files, THIS FILE IS WRONG.

Templates in this folder mirror the required filenames in the repo:
- CHANGELOG.md
